This package contains three different formulations for the global optimization model of curvature regularization.

We use the cvxopt package to try to solve the problems. In order to use convex optimization, the energy should
respect some properties. In the case of quadratic energies, the coefficient matrix correponding to the second order
term must be semi-definite positive.

All models here are continuous, i.e., variables are allowed to assume any value between 0 and 1.
For each model we derive a constrained and a penalty version.

    The original third order energy is converted in a quadratic energy by means of linearization of second order terms
    of type Pixel*Linel.

    An additional variable z is created for the pair.
    For each variable z, three constraints are included:
        z <= xi
        z <= xj
        z >= xi+xj-1


****PixelLinel

    Same as above, but the linearized second order term is of the form: Pixel*Pixel


For the quadratic formulations, both constrained and penalty formulations have a non semi-definite positive matrix.
